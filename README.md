# chess-engine

A reasonably capable chess engine that was written as a personal project and learning experience. 
Utilizes the UCI framework as well as several chess programming concepts such as alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables 
to speed up move evaluation. 

Can be built by entering the chess-engine directory and running `cargo b --release`. A binary will be generated that can be used in 
any UCI compliant chess GUI.
